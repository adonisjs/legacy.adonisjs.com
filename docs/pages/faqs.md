[collapse title="How to use npm packages with AdonisJS?"]

Somehow, there is a mis-conception that using npm packages with AdonisJS requires extra work and this is not true.

Using an npm package is as simple as installing it and then importing it anywhere inside your application.

```sh
npm i lodash
```

```ts
import { get } from 'lodash'
```
