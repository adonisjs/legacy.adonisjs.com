## Commits

- **addition**: Add support for basic auth [9d684e82](https://github.com/adonisjs/auth/commit/9d684e82b2914f506f929a0668efc1e87ae858af)

## Updating Auth Middleware
The Auth middleware stored inside `app/Middleware/Auth.ts` file has been updated to pass the guard name to the [raised exception](https://github.com/adonisjs/auth/blob/develop/templates/middleware/Auth.txt#L54). We recommend upgrading the middleware source for correct behavior.

If you have not made any changes to the middleware, then simply copy/paste the contents from this [stub](https://github.com/adonisjs/auth/blob/develop/templates/middleware/Auth.txt).
