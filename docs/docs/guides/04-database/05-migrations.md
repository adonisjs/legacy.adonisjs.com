# Schema Migrations
[Schema migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration) is a concept of evolving the database schema overtime. By the end of this guide, you will know:

- What is schema migrations and how it works
- Using the Lucid Javascript API to create, alter or delete tables.
- The Lucid commands to run or rollback migrations.

## Migrations Overview
Database schema migrations is one of the most confusing topics in software programming. Many times individuals don't even understand the need of using migrations vs manually creating database tables. So, let's take a step backward and explore the possible options for creating/modifying tables inside a database.

### Using a GUI Application
The simplest way to create database tables is to make use of a GUI application like Sequel Pro, Table plus and so on. These applications are great during the development phase, however, they have some short-comings during the production workflow.

- You need to expose your database server to the internet, so that the GUI application on your computer can connect to the production database.
- You cannot tie the database changes to your deployment workflow. Every deployment impacting the database will require manual intervention.
- Their is no history of your tables. You do not know, when and how a database modification was done.

### Custom SQL Scripts
Another option is to create SQL scripts and run them during the deployment process. However, you will have to manually build a tracking system to ensure that you are not running the previously ran SQL scripts. For example:

- You write a SQL script to create a new `users` table.
- You run this script as part of the deployment workflow. However, you have to make sure that the next deployment must ignore the previously executed sql script.

### Using Schema Migrations
Schema migrations addresses the above issues and offers a robust API for evolving and tracking database changes. There are many tools available for schema migrations ranging from framework agnostic tools like [flywaydb](https://flywaydb.org/) to framework specific tooling offered by Rails, Laravel and so on.

Similarly, AdonisJS also has its own migrations system. You can create/modify database by writing Javascript.

## Creating Your First Migration
Let's begin by executing the following ace command to create a new migration file.

[note]
Make sure that the development server is running by running `node ace serve --watch`.
[/note]

```sh
node ace make:migration users
# âœ”  create    database/migrations/1584350623957_users.ts
```

Open the newly created file inside the text editor and replace its content with the following code snippet.

```ts
import BaseSchema from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Schema'

export default class Users extends BaseSchema {
  protected $tableName = 'users'

  public async up () {
    this.schema.createTable(this.$tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments('id').primary()
      table.string('email').unique().notNullable()
      table.string('password').notNullable()
      table.timestamps()
    })
  }

  public async down () {
    this.schema.dropTable(this.$tableName)
  }
}
```

Finally, run the following ace command to execute the instructions for creating the `users` table.

```sh
node ace migration:run

# completed database/migrations/1584350623957_users (batch: 1) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

Congratulations! You have just created and executed your first migration. If you re-run the same command, Lucid will not execute the migration file, since it has already been executed.

```sh
node ace migration:run

# Already upto date ðŸ‘ˆ
```

### How it works?

- The `make:migration` command creates a new migration file prefixed with the timestamp. The timestamp is important, because the migrations are executed in the ascending order by name.
- Migration files are not only limited to creating a new table. You can also `alter` table, define database triggers and so on.
- The `migration:run` command executes all pending migrations. Once a migration file has been successfully executed, it will be tracked inside the `adonis_schema` database table to avoid running it for multiple times.

## Changing Existing Migrations
Occasionally you will make mistakes when writing a migration. If you have already run the migration using `migration:run` command, then you cannot just edit the file and re-run it, since the file has been tracked under the list of completed migrations.

Instead, you can rollback the migration by running the `migration:rollback` command. Assuming the previously created migration file already exists, running the rollback command will drop the `users` table.

```sh
node ace migration:rollback

# completed database/migrations/1584350623957_users (batch: 1)
```

### How rollback works?
- Every migration class has two methods, `up` and `down`. The `down` is called during the rollback process.
- You (the developer) is responsible for writing correct instructions to undo the changes made by the `up` method. For example: If `up` method creates a table, then the `down` method must drop it.
- After rollback, Lucid considers the migration file as pending and running `migration:run` will re-run it.

### Avoiding Rollbacks
Performing a rollback during development is perfectly fine, since there is no fear of data loss. However, performing a rollback in production is not really an option in majority of cases. Consider this example:

- You create and run a migration to setup the `users` table.
- Overtime this table has received data, since the app is running in production.
- You realize, that one of the column is missing inside the `users` table.
- Now, you cannot edit the existing migration file and perform rollback, since the rollback will drop the table, resulting in data loss.

[tip]
Lucid also allows disabling rollbacks in production by setting `migrations.disableRollbacksInProduction` flag in the connection config.
[/tip]

Instead, you create a new migration that adds this new column to the existing `users` table. For example

[codegroup]

```sh{}{Make Migration}
node ace make:migration add_last_login_column --table=users

# âœ”  create    database/migrations/1584415438372_add_last_login_columns.ts
```

```ts{}{Migration}
import BaseSchema from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Schema'

export default class Users extends BaseSchema {
  protected $tableName = 'users'

  public async up () {
    this.schema.table(this.$tableName, (table) => {
      // highlight-start
      table.dateTime('last_login_at')
      // highlight-end
    })
  }

  public async down () {
    this.schema.table(this.$tableName, (table) => {
      table.dropColumn('last_login_at')
    })
  }
}
```

[/codegroup]

## Migrations Config
The configuration for migrations is stored inside the `config/database.ts` file under the connection config object.

```ts{}{config/database.ts}
{
  mysql: {
    client: 'mysql',
    migrations: {
      disableTransactions: false,
      paths: ['database/migrations'],
      tableName: 'adonis_schema',
      disableRollbacksInProduction: true,
    }
  }
}
```

- Instructions inside a migration file are wrapped inside a database transaction. You can disable the use of transactions by setting `disableTransactions = true`.
- You can define multiple `paths` from which to read the migrations files. The migrations are executed in sequence of the defined paths.
- The `tableName` property allows you to customize the table name for tracking completed migrations.
- Since rollbacks can lead to data loss, you can disable them in production by setting `disableRollbacksInProduction = true`.
