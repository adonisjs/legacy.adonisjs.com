# Serializing Models
If you are creating a RESTful API server, then you would want to serialize your model instances to JSON before sending them back in a response. In this guide, we will go through the serialization API.

## Serializing a model
You can serialize a model to a plain object by using `serialize` or `toJSON` methods. The `toJSON` is just an alias for the former one. For demonstration, lets create a model and serialize it.

```sh
node ace make:model Post
```

Open the newly created file and paste the following contents inside it.

```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import { BaseModel, column } from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm'

export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  public id: number

  @column()
  public title: string

  @column()
  public slug: string

  @column()
  public body: string

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true })
  public createdAt: DateTime

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true, autoUpdate: true })
  public updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

For the sake of simplicity, we will create an instance locally and then call the `serialize` method.

```ts
const post = new Post()
post.title = 'Adonis 101'
post.slug = 'adonis-101'
post.body = 'Some dummy content'
post.createdAt = DateTime.local()
post.updatedAt = DateTime.local()

console.log(post.serialize())
```

Output

### Points to note
- The `serialize` method only includes the properties using the `@column` decorator. Everything else is ignored.
- The property names are converted from `camelCase` to `snake_case`, since majority of APIs use `snake_case` property names.
- The Luxon date objects are converted to `ISO` date-time strings.

## Customizing property names
By default, Lucid will convert `camelCase` property names to `snake_case`. However, you can easily customize the property names by using the `serializeAs` option. For example:

```ts
export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  @column.dateTime({
    autoCreate: true,
    // highlight-start
    serializeAs: 'creation_date',
    // highlight-end
  })
  public createdAt: DateTime
}
```

```ts
console.log(post.serialize())

/**
  Output
  {
    ...,
    creation_date: '2020-04-24T21:54:12.727+05:30',
  }
*/
```

## Hiding properties

To hide a property from getting serialized, you can set `serializeAs = null`.

```ts
export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  // highlight-start
  @column({ serializeAs: null })
  // highlight-end
  public slug: string
}
```

```ts
console.log(post.serialize())

/**
  Output
  {
    title: 'Adonis 101',
    body: 'Some dummy content',
    created_at: '2020-04-24T21:54:12.727+05:30',
    updated_at: '2020-04-24T21:54:12.746+05:30'
  }
*/
```

### Cherry picking fields

The `serializeAs` option turn off the properties from getting serialized at the global level. However, there we will be times, when you want to decide this on per request basis and this is where cherry picking fields can help you.

The `serialize` method optionally accepts an option to pick/omit fields from getting serialized.

```ts
post.serialize({
  fields: ['title', 'body']
})
```

You can also define the fields to omit vs the fields to pick.

```ts
post.serialize({
  fields: {
    omit: ['created_at', 'updated_at']
  }
})
```

Finally, you can repeat this process for the relationships as well.

```ts
post.serialize({
  fields: {
    omit: ['created_at', 'updated_at']
  },
  relations: {
    comments: {
      fields: ['body', 'id']
    }
  }
})
```

**During cherry picking, the column names are matched against the `serializeAs` names and not the model property names. WHY?**

Imagine you are creating a JSON API server and you decided to allow the users of your API to define the fields they want to be returned in the response.

The users of your API doesn't know about the property names that exists on your models. They only know about the property names they see in the response (ie. the `serializeAs` name) and hence the cherry picking API matches against the `serializeAs` names.


## Customizing value
Along with the serialized property names, you can also customize the value of a given column by defining a custom `serialize` method.

```ts
export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  @column.dateTime({
    autoCreate: true,
    // highlight-start
    serialize: (value?: DateTime) => {
      return value ? value.setZone('utc').toISO() : value
    },
    // highlight-end
  })
  public createdAt: DateTime
}
```

## Serializing relationships
The `serialize` method recursively serializes all the preloaded relationships by invoking the same method on the related models. Consider the following example.

```ts{}{app/Models/User.ts}
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import { BaseModel, column, hasMany, HasMany } from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm'
import Post from 'App/Models/Post'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  public id: number

  @hasMany(() => Post)
  public posts: HasMany<typeof Post>
}
```

In the above model definition, **a user has many posts**. Lets run a query to select all the posts for a given user and then serialize the user model instance.

```ts
import User from 'App/Models/User'

const user = await User
  .query()
  .where('id', 1)
  .preload('posts') // ðŸ‘ˆpreloading posts
  .firstOrFail()

console.log(user.serialize())
```

Output

### Customizing relationship name
You can customize the property name for the serialized relationship.

```ts
export class User extends BaseModel {
  @hasMany(() => Post, {
    // highlight-start
    serializeAs: 'writings'
    // highlight-end
  })
  public posts: HasMany<typeof Post>
}
```

## Computed properties
As stated earlier, the `serialize` method ignores all the model properties except the one using the `@column` decorator. 

There will be times, when you want to include custom properties inside the serialized output, but without defining them inside the database, and this is where the computed properties come into the picture.

[note]
The serialization process is synchronous and hence you cannot use `async/await` on the computed properties.
[/note]

```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import truncatise from 'truncatise'
import { BaseModel, column, computed } from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm'

export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  @column()
  public body: string

  @computed()
  public get excerpt () {
    return truncatise(this.body, { TruncateLength: 50 })
  }
}
```

The properties using the `@computed` decorator will be included inside the serialized output.

## Serializing `$extras`
Properties not defined on the model as [columns](/guides/models/columns) are moved to the `$extras` object. For example:

```ts
const posts = await Post.query().withCount('comments')
```

The above query loads the number of comments for every post as `comments_count` property. Since `comments_count` is a runtime value (not pre-defined on the model), the value will be moved to the `$extras` object.

```ts
posts.forEach((post) => {
  console.log(post.$extras.comments_count)
})
```

The `$extras` object is not serialized when using `post.serialize` or `post.toJSON`, since it may contain sensitive data. However, you can instruct the model to serialize the `$extras` by defining the `serializeExtras` property.

```ts
class Post extends BaseModel {
  public serializeExtras = true
}
```

Or define a custom serialize function.

```ts
class Post extends BaseModel {
  public serializeExtras() {
    return {
      commentsCount: this.$extras.comments_count,
    }
  }
}
```
